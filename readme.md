# Spotify Discovery VR

[Demo](http://tomvalorsa.github.io/)

This is a simple playlist creator for Spotify which allows users to explore music related to their top artists. This is my final project for the fantastic [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). I used the open brief for the final project as an excuse to play with the [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) WebVR framework.

## Usage:

- log into your Spotify account when prompted so the app can get permission to access your top artists and make you a playlist
- select an artist to begin listening to their top tracks
- use the playback controls to cycle through an artist's tracks or find related artists
- when finished select the record at your feet (i.e. look down) to save the playlist
- go and listen to it on Spotify!

_N.B. Still a bit buggy, improvements still being made :)_
